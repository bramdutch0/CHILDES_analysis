This directory contains two executable programs "artificial_data_experiment" and
"real_data_experiment" which are used on CHILDES data found at https://childes.talkbank.org/. It also contains libraries "extract_data.py", "Helper.py" and "Learner.py" which are used for the experiments.


--------------------
real_data_experiment
--------------------
This file tests a set of learners on data from a longitudinal 
study from the CHILDES database and calculates F1, precision, and
recall for each learner by taking nonchild utterances as input to the 
learners and child data as tests where the constructions the child
knows are compared to the predicted constructions each learner knows.

To run this program, use "python real_data_experiment.py [Directory 
with data in it]." The directory should contain files with preparsed data of the form
*[speaker]: [Utterance]
%gra: [parse of sentence]
And should use "CHI" to indicate the child is speaking

A list of learners is set up in the main() function. This list can be altered.
Documentation on the parameters for different learners can be found in 
Learner.py

The output of this program is stored in "results/real_data/[Directory with 
data in it]/". Output includes precision, recall, and F1 files which contain
the respective values at each test point as well as average_precision, average_recall,
and average_F1 that averages for each learner over all test points.

--------------------------
Arfiticial Data Experiment
--------------------------
This program extracts a list of constructions from a CHILDES
file and tests a set of learners on the data to see the order 
that constructions are acquired and the speed at which constructions
are acquired. This program tests both a uniform distribution over 
the constructions present and an observed distribution based on the
frequency in the CHILDES files.

To run this program use "python artificial_data_experiment.py [directory
where data is stored]". The directory should contain files with preparsed data of the form
*[speaker]: [Utterance]
%gra: [parse of sentence]
And should use "CHI" to indicate the child is speaking

A list of learners is set up in the main() function. This list can be altered.
Documentation on the parameters for different learners can be found in 
Learner.py

Will run 

The output of this program is stored in "results/artificial_data/[directory where 
data is stored]
Output includes 
uniform/number_constructions- the average number of constructions every 10 time steps averaged
	over all of the experiments for a uniform distribution
uniform/order- the average order constructions were acquired over all the experiments
	for a uniform distribution
observed/number_constructions- the average number of constructions every 10 time steps averaged
	over all of the experiments for an observed distribution
observed/order- the average order constructions were acquired over all the experiments
	for an observed distribution

The order and number of constructions for each trial are also stored in seperate folders

Input files

Both experimental programs are run on longitudinal databases that have been
parsed already on the CHILDES website https://childes.talkbank.org/.
